# 8085 Microprocessor Simulator App.

Welcome to the 8085 Microprocessor Simulator Web App.

## Overview

This project provides a user-friendly app interface for simulating the 8085 microprocessor. **The simulator allows you to interact with an emulated 8085 microprocessor through a Streamlit-based application with a chat-like frontend**. Execute instructions, observe the microprocessor's state, and explore various components such as registers, memory, flags, ports, and more using natural language commands.

## Features

- Execute a variety of 8085 instructions using an intuitive chat-like interface.
- Streamlined commands for exploring the state of the microprocessor.
- AI feature for contextual understanding of 8085 microprocessor-related questions.
- Ability to execute instructions bitwise or in compile mode.
