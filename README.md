# 8085 Microprocessor Simulator App.

Welcome to the 8085 Microprocessor Simulator App with a Chat Interface!

## Overview

This project provides a user-friendly app interface for simulating the 8085 microprocessor. The simulator allows you to interact with an emulated 8085 microprocessor through a Streamlit-based application with a chat-like frontend. Execute instructions, observe the microprocessor's state, and explore various components such as registers, memory, flags, ports, and more using natural language commands.

## Features

- Execute a variety of 8085 instructions using an intuitive chat-like interface.
- View the contents of registers, memory, flags, ports, and other components dynamically.
- Streamlined commands for exploring the state of the microprocessor.
- Clear the display for a clean and organized user interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the simulator app, ensure that you have the required Python modules installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install streamlit prettytable
```

### Running the Simulator App
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
https://github.com/girisakar365/8085-mP.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd 8085-mP
```
3. Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Usage
After launching the simulator app, you will be greeted with an introduction and a chat-like interactive interface.

Enter 8085 microprocessor instructions in the provided chat input box to execute various operations. For example:

__Explore the state of the microprocessor using interactive commands available in the chat-like interface.__

### Note
As of now, not all instructions are available, and updates are constantly being made. Instructions up to arithmetic operations are supported.
Ensure that you provide valid arguments and follow the correct syntax for each instruction.

### Supported Platforms
The simulator app is compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Windows: No additional considerations.
Linux: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies by running the command mentioned under ["Prerequisites"](#prerequisites).
macOS: Similar to Linux, ensure the required dependencies are installed.
